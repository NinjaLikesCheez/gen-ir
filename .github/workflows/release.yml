name: Release Update

# This workflow merges a PR and, optionally, releases a GitHub Release with an auto bumped version.

# Using the merge-bump-<VERSION> label on a PR, you can choose to bump the major, minor, or patch version
# Using the merge-no-bump label on a PR, you can merge the PR with no version change

# You should only attach **one** of these labels, anymore will result in undefined behavior as to which bump will be performed.


# Run only on labeled Pull Requests
