  Generate LLVM IR from an Xcode Build Log
</h4>

`gen-ir` is a tool to enable developers to generate LLVM IR from an Xcode Build Log. It does this by parsing the log for compiler commands, adjusting those commands to produce IR, and then rerunning them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you use

It's important to know that `gen-ir` requires that a **full** build log is provided.

**This means a clean, fresh build of a project.**

The compiler will **not** make a call for an object that doesn't need to be rebuilt, and we will not be able to parse what doesn't exist. Ensure you do a clean before your build otherwise `gen-ir` may miss some modules.

## Usage

Run `gen-ir --help` for the latest usage.

`gen-ir` takes input by two means, a path to a file or stdin:

```bash
# Path to build log (you can export from inside of Xcode too)
xcodebuild clean && xcodebuild build -project TestProject.xcodeproj -scheme TestProject -configuration Debug > build_log.txt
gen-ir build_log.txt ir_files/

# Stdin (you may need to redirect stderr to stdout here, Xcode is weird about writing to it sometimes)
xcodebuild clean && xcodebuild build -project TestProject.xcodeproj -scheme TestProject -configuration Debug | gen-ir - ir_files/
```

## Installing

### Homebrew

A tap is avaliable 

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- Xcode 14+

## Building

In a shell, change into the project directory and run:

```sh
swift build
```

The tool will be output to `.build/debug/gen-ir`
